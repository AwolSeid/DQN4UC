Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation Environment for Power Scheduling

This environment is used to simulate mono- to tri-objective power scheduling problems dynamics in the form of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
To tackle the dimensionality challenges associated with MOPS, 
- Illegal actions by agents are to be automatically corrected.
- Shortages or excess capacities are adjusted.
The MDPS can then be used to train a custom deep learning model.
The practical viability of the environment is evaluated on different test systems featuring mono- to tri-objective problems.
